# Hearts
This project is an implementation of the classic card game Hearts in Java. The project involves designing and implementing several classes including Card, Deck, Player, Hearts, and HeartsGUI. The game follows the standard rules of Hearts where players aim to score the fewest points by avoiding certain cards and winning tricks.
